Clojure is a programming language for the JVM. I like Clojure for its simplicity and power.
For example clojure has a function called juxt which can be used like this

	(def +- (juxt + -))

Clojure also has good support for concurency through stm and the
functional style of programming.

*Functional Programming* is programming with functions preferably pure ones.
