Finding the right balance between quick and dirty and strict code can be a chalenge.
Some programming languages do a better job than others: 

* Ruby has a monkey patch everything mentality -- but the culture has sound enginering practices.
* Python is also very dynamic and freewheleing language -- but the users know what they are doing.
* Clojure has a simaler culture to lisp and ruby. Macroaligy being an important part of the culture.
* PHP on the otherhand is a slop-fest. 

It starts at the top, Rasmus Lerdorf throws together slop to make things work.
He does not know how to write good programs in any sense of the word.
Some other groups like the wordpress people write nice user level programs,
but the code is utter spagetti.

Clojure is a beutiful lisp dialect, with a pragmatic and smart founder.
Clojure helps find the balance between hackish and maintainable code.
